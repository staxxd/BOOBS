# Why would anyone need a list of a thousand ways to say boobies?
> For their Twitter header, duh! 

If there's anything that is a direct representation of me it's boobs. I'd like to compile a list of unique and fun ways to say BOOBS! 
And create a awesome new header for my Twitter by making a cool collage that has the most likeable words or phrases arranged with a few
of the cute cartoon pics I have been collecting.

## I need your help. I know you guys have got some pretty insane imaginations so feel to share as much as you'd like!
All I do ask is for you to please not be very vulgar, let's try to keep it light-hearted, goofy and graceful if we can k?


*** 
I also understand there are a group of people who may not think talking about boobs or showing your set off on Twitter but to you I say 
You do your own thing, I do mine. I think your time would be better spent NOT acknowledging things you don't understand or enjoy and 
doing whatver gay ass shit it is you want to do. ;D So fuck you, and goodnight. 

> The rest of you, IDGAF as much about up-votes as I do you leaving your feedback in a comment. :D
